# Using the Dispatcher Optimizer Tool (DOT)

This experiment demonstrates how to use the Dispatcher Optimizer Tool, its Maven Plug-In in particular, to create
better configurations, following best practices and easily spotting inadvertent configuration errors.

## Compatibility

This experiment is compatible with both AEM 6.5 and AEM as a Cloud Service.

## Problem

The Dispatcher configuration is complicated and is easily left to the end of a project.  At that point it is
tempting to do whatever it takes to get the Dispatcher to work without following steps that will avoid problems in
the future.  The approach of "good enough" is often taken and only later after CSOs, privacy leaks and DoS attacks
is the configuration updated.

It is also easy to end up with a configuration with syntax errors.  These errors can be hard to spot when
the dispatcher configuration is large.

**Security** - it should be noted that although the Dispatcher can be closed to mitigate certain breaches, it
should **NOT** be considered as a security wall.  The Publish tier should follow all the security best practises
to be secure.

The DOT can be used a few ways:
* Settings can be added to a Maven POM for the Dispatcher configuration.  This will trigger the
  DOT to execute within the 'analyze' livecycle during development, giving the developer immediate feedback on the
  perceived accuracy of the Dispatcher configuration.
* The DOT is used in Adobe's AEM Cloud Service Pipeline, where it is run automatically to analyze the contained
  configuration.
* A developer can use the open-source DOT Core library to create a new application, perhaps for the command line.

This experiment deals with the DOT Maven Plug-In.

## Setup

Follow the instructions on the main experiments page.

***
![#ff0101](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ff0101/000000?text=+)
**NOTE**: The command **mvn dispatcher-optimizer:analyze** uses Maven's 
[Plugin Prefix Resolution](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-plugin-prefix-mapping.html).
If the prefix ("dispatcher-optimizer") cannot be resolved in the local or remote repositories,
which can happen if those repos cannot be reached (ex: require VPN, no internet, etc.), an error
similar to the following will be displayed:
```
"No plugin found for prefix 'dispatcher-optimizer'..."
```
To resolve that error do one of the following
  - ensure the remote repos are reachable (ex: connect through VPN)
  - use the fully-featured form: 
  **mvn com.adobe.aem.dot:dispatcher-optimizer-maven-plugin:analyze** 

This should only happen once, since afterwards it would reside in your local Maven repo.

## Test #1: Running the DOT Maven Plug-In

If you followed the instructions on the main page, you are almost done this experiment.
- `cd` to `aem-dispatcher-experiments/dispatcher-config-basic`
- Execute: `mvn dispatcher-optimizer:analyze` (_Error?  See ["Setup"](#setup) note above._)
- Watch the console for information about the configuration (in some cases these are directed to the logs).
- Two reports were written to `dispatcher-config-basic/target/dispatcher-optimizer-tool`:
  - results.csv : a comma, separated file
  - results.html : a html file, more friendly to the human eye
- Open `dispatcher-config-basic/target/dispatcher-optimizer-tool/results.html` in a browser
  (_used in subsequent tests_).
- The CSV file contains the same information as the HTML, and is more easily used for scanning by automation.
- Survey the information that the DOT found.

## Test #2: Fix a violation

The HTML from Test #1 should have shown an "Unknown Token" violation around line 89 for the _dispatcher.any_ file 
citing  the token "/0003".  An "Unknown Token" means there were expected tokens at that location in the configuration,
and the specified token was not one of those.

Let's investigate that violation.

- Edit _dispatcher-config-basic/private/etc/apache2/conf/dispatcher.any_.
- Around line 89, find the "/0003" element.
- This may look fine, or perhaps you may see the problem right away.  We can guess the author was hoping to deny all
  requests that are going to _/top/secret/data_.  So what is the problem?  Notice the closing brace on line 87.  That
  closes the /filter section.  Our "/0003" token was most likely intended to be inside the /filter section.
- Either delete the whole /0003 line or move the line to the bottom of the /filter section and save the file. 
- As was done in Test #1, run the DOT again: `mvn dispatcher-optimizer:analyze`.
- Refresh or Open `dispatcher-config-basic/target/dispatcher-optimizer-tool/results.html`.
- Notice the violation for line 89 (/0003) is longer was reported. (Right?  If it is still there, edit the file
  again.)

Imagine the results of this violation in a public environment - _/top/secret/data_ might have been publicly available
if the Publish tier was not fully secured.

## Test #3: Run the DOT Maven Plug-In on your project

- Find a Dispatcher configuration that you have for your own AEM environment
- Setup a POM file:
  - If there is **no** pom.xml for that configuration:
    - Copy `aem-dispatcher-experiments/pom.xml` to a folder whose children eventually contain both 
      `dispatcher.any` and `httpd.conf` files.
    - Feel free to edit the copied pom's <artifactId> to make it your own.
  - If there **is** an existing POM.xml file:
    - Add the `dispatcher-optimizer-maven-plugin` to the _build/plugins_ section of that existing POM.
    - See `aem-dispatcher-experiments/pom.xml` for an example.
    - Update the `dispatcherModuleDir` and `dispatcherConfigPath` to point to the exact file as required.
- `cd` to the directory with that POM file.
- Execute `mvn dispatcher-optimizer:analyze`
- Watch the console for information about the configuration (in some cases these are directed to the logs).
- Open the generated file: `target/dispatcher-optimizer-tool/results.html`
- Survey the information that the DOT found. Explanations of each of the core rules can be found by following
  the report links or 
  [in the DOT public repo](https://github.com/adobe/aem-dispatcher-optimizer-tool/blob/main/docs/Rules.md).
- Update your config to fix the violations that are of concern, and run the DOT again.

It is recommended to use the most recent version of the Dispatcher Optimizer Tool.  See 
[DOT's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adobe/aem-dispatcher-optimizer-tool)
for more technical information.

## Test #4 - Change report verbosity

Edit the POM file used in any of the previous tests, and change the `<reportVerbosity>` setting
to control the amount of information that is included in the report.  Then run the 'analyze' command
and compare the results.  The options for Verbosity are:
- FULL
- PARTIAL
- MINIMIZED

Example: 
```
<reportVerbosity>MINIMIZED</reportVerbosity>
```

Check
[DOT's GitHub Repo](https://github.com/adobe/aem-dispatcher-optimizer-tool/tree/main/plugin#configuration)
for details on the different options for the Report Verbosity.

For simple Dispatcher's there may actually be little difference.  For real world configurations, it can
reduce the report rows by 100's of (repeated) violations, making the list easier to act upon.

## Test #5 - Overlay some rules

Hopefully the value of the DOT is starting to become clear.  You may start to imagine new rules that you would like
to implement.  Or you may notice a rule and decide, after very careful consideration, that you want to silence
it (usually not recommended) or change its severity.  Let's see how to do that.

The DOT allows the user to extend the core rules.  To create a new rule, first review the properties of a rule by
reviewing [the official specifications](https://github.com/adobe/aem-dispatcher-optimizer-tool/tree/main/core#rules)
and 
[instructions on how to extend the rules](https://github.com/adobe/aem-dispatcher-optimizer-tool/tree/main/core#extending-the-core-rules)
on that same page.

Also review the 
[core rules provided with DOT](https://github.com/adobe/aem-dispatcher-optimizer-tool/blob/main/core/src/main/resources/core-rules.json).

### Relax a rule

Let's make the `DOTRules:Disp-7---selector-allow-list` rule less urgent...

In the experiment's pom file in "dispatcher-config-basic" the <optimizerRulesPath> value is already set to "rules"
directory.  Any rule files in that directory will be read in alphabetical order, and applied to the
currently loaded rule set.  We will edit that file to extend the core rules.

- Edit `dispatcher-config-basic/rules/experiment_rules.json`
- Replace the contents with the following lines to duplicate the rule and save.  The "EXTEND" makes an attempt
  to merge the new the steps rules with the rules already loaded.  Incidentally, "REPLACE" clears what is already
  loaded, and starts anew.
```
{
  "mergeMode": "EXTEND",
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "DOTRules:Disp-7---selector-allow-list",
      "description": "The Dispatcher publish farm filters should specify the allowed Sling selectors in an allow list manner.",
      "severity": "MAJOR",
      "farmTypeList": ["PUBLISH"],
      "element": "farm.filter",
      "type": "Code Smell",
      "tags": ["beta","dispatcher"],
      "enabled": true,
      "checks": [
        {
          "condition": "FILTER_LIST_INCLUDES",
          "filterValue": {
            "type": "DENY",
            "url": "/content*",
            "selectors": "*"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
- Lower the rule's severity by changing `severity` to `"INFO"`
- Save the file and run the DOT again.
- Check the "results.html" file and see how the `DOTRules:Disp-7` appears, paying attention to its severity.

### Quiet a rule

Let's make the `DOTRules:Disp-7---selector-allow-list` not even appear (again, not recommended)...

- Edit `dispatcher-config-basic/rules/experiment_rules.json`
- Restore the `severity` to `"MAJOR"`
- Disable the rule by changing `enabled` to `false`
- Save the file and run the DOT again.
- Check the "results.html" file and see if the `DOTRules:Disp-7` appears.

### Create a rule

Your organization may come up with its own rules.  Let's say you decide that /filter's with type "ALLOW" should not
be permitted to specify the value using a /glob setting.  Let's implement that.

- Edit `dispatcher-config-basic/rules/experiment_rules.json`
- Delete its contents and replace it with the following:
```
{
  "mergeMode": "EXTEND",
  "rules": [
    {
      "id": "experiment-1---no-globs",
      "description": "Allow filters should not use /glob values",
      "severity": "MAJOR",
      "farmTypeList": ["PUBLISH"],
      "element": "farm.filter",
      "type": "Code Smell",
      "tags": ["experiment"],
      "enabled": true,
      "checks": [
        {
          "failIf": true,
          "condition": "FILTER_LIST_INCLUDES",
          "filterValue": {
            "type": "ALLOW",
            "glob": "regex(.*)"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
- NOTE: This rule would say pass if the filter contains a glob, but we use the "failIf" setting to reverse the
  condition.
- Save the file and run the DOT again.
- Check the "results.html" file and notice "experiment-1" is not reported.
- Edit the `dispatcher.any` file and add this line to the /filter section (around line 77)
  - ``` /experiment1 { /glob "*" /type "allow" } ```
- Save the file and run the DOT again.
- Check the "results.html" file and notice "experiment-1" is now reported!

To maintain the test state, delete the contents of `dispatcher-config-basic/rules/experiment_rules.json`, revert
the changes to `dispatcher.any` and save the files.
